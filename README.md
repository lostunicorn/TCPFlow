TCPFlow
=======
TCPFlow is a tool for visual representation of a TCP flow. The flow we use
is unidirectional, to keep things as simple as possible, with the intent
of illustrating the concepts used in a TCP connection as clearly as
possible.

TCPFlow is intended for educational purposes, both to generate clear
examples for use in course material and to provide students with an
interactive tool to better understand the mechanisms used in reliable
network protocols.

TCPFlow is released under a GPLv3 license, so you are allowed to modify
and/or distribute the source code. You are not allowed to sell it as source
code or in binary form. If you want to publish modifications to the code,
please submit your changes to the TCPFlow GitHub repository.

If you want to create a fork, you are, of course, free to do so.
